## Access All NVD Data via NIST API

The 'get-nvd-api.py' script allows users to pull all vulnerability information directly from the NIST NVD API.  I have included SQL tables to support how users can import this information into their own database for analysis.

### Usage

Please modify the connection string and/or the data that you would like to fetch and/or the tables you would like to create before running the script.

```python3 get-nvd-api.py```

Currently, I am storing the following data types from the NVD API for analysis (obviously can be modified to grab more):
- cve_id
- source_identifier
- published_date
- last_modified_date
- vuln_status
- description
#### CVSS v2 Scoring
- base_score
- vector_string
- access_vector
- access_complexity
- authentication
- confidentiality_impact
- integrity_impact
- availability_impact
- exploitability_score
- impact_score

#### CVSS v3 Scoring
- cvss_v3_base_score
- cvss_v3_vector_string
- cvss_v3_exploitability_score
- cvss_v3_impact_score

#### CVSS v3.1 Scoring
- cvss_v31_base_score
- cvss_v31_vector_string
- cvss_v31_exploitability_score
- cvss_v31_impact_score

### Notes

This will fetch all CVEs, regardless of Vulnerability Status, so it will include the rejected candidates.  Here is the breakdown of vulnerability status' by definition from NIST: 

| CVE List Status | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| RESERVED | A CVE Entry is marked as "RESERVED" when it has been reserved for use by a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) or security researcher, but the details of it are not yet populated. A CVE Entry can change from the RESERVED state to being populated at any time based on a number of factors both internal and external to the CVE List. |
| PUBLISHED | The CVE Entry is populated with details. These are a CVE Description and reference link[s] regarding details of the CVE. |
| DISPUTED | When one party disagrees with another party's assertion that a particular issue in software is a vulnerability, a CVE Entry assigned to that issue may be designated as being "DISPUTED". In these cases, CVE is making no determination as to which party is correct. Instead, we make note of this dispute and try to offer any public references that will better inform those trying to understand the facts of the issue. When you see a CVE Entry that is "DISPUTED", we encourage you to research the issue through the references or by contacting the affected vendor or developer for more information. |
| REJECT | A CVE Entry listed as "REJECT" is a CVE Entry that is not accepted as a CVE Entry. The reason a CVE Entry is marked REJECT will most often be stated in the description of the CVE Entry. Possible examples include it being a duplicate CVE Entry, it being withdrawn by the original requester, it being assigned incorrectly, or some other administrative reason. As a rule, REJECT CVE Entries should be ignored. |
