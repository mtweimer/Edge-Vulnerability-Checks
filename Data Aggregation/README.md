### Access All NVD Data via NIST API

The 'get-nvd-api.py' script allows users to pull all vulnerability information directly from the NIST NVD API.  I have included SQL tables to support how users can import this information into their own database for analysis.

Currently, I am storing the following data types from the NVD API for analysis (obviously can be modified to grab more):
- cve_id
- source_identifier
- published_date
- last_modified_date
- vuln_status
- description
#### CVSS v2 Scoring
- base_score
- vector_string
- access_vector
- access_complexity
- authentication
- confidentiality_impact
- integrity_impact
- availability_impact
- exploitability_score
- impact_score

#### CVSS v3 Scoring
- cvss_v3_base_score
- cvss_v3_vector_string
- cvss_v3_exploitability_score
- cvss_v3_impact_score

#### CVSS v3.1 Scoring
- cvss_v31_base_score
- cvss_v31_vector_string
- cvss_v31_exploitability_score
- cvss_v31_impact_score
